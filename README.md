i3-focus-last
=============

[![Crate](https://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/i3-focus-last)](https://crates.io/crates/i3-focus-last)

Another implementation of this classic (and useful) example of i3 ipc use.

Works on reasonable versions of i3 and sway's master branch.

Done in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org):

* for fun!
* it's compiled, so we won't suffer from the overhead of starting a new
  interpreter for each client (the python version I used was sluggish at
  times, for this reason)
